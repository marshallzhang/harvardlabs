('Arlotta Laboratory', 'The genetic programs that control the differentiation of distinct types of neurons in the brain are still largely unknown. In our lab we address this issue in the cerebral cortex. Our main interest lies in investigating the mechanisms that govern the development of distinct subtypes of neurons of the neocortex, and in developing approaches to aid neuronal regeneration in the context of neurodegenerative and traumatic disease of the cortical output circuitry.nAmong the different classes of cortical neurons, we are primarily interested in the signals that induce differentiation and regeneration of corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN), a clinically relevant neuronal population that in humans selectively degenerates in ALS (Lou Gehrig''s disease), Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) and Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS), and is permanently injured in spinal cord injury (SCI).'),
('Camargo Laboratory', 'The Camargo laboratory focuses on the study of adult stem cell biology, organ size regulation, and cancer.nnDespite fantastic progress in developmental biology research over the past decade, one aspect of development and tissue homeostasis for which very little is understood is how individual tissues reach and then maintain their appropriate size. Classic studies have demonstrated that tissues are able to ''sense'' their size and expand or shrink until a correct dimension has been reached. Nevertheless, the nature of the molecules and pathways involved in this process remain mysterious.nnOur laboratory utilizes a variety of genetic, biochemical, and high throughput technologies to identify molecules and mechanisms that regulate this fascinating process in mammals. We are particularly interested in studying the function of the newly discovered Hippo signaling pathway and its effects on tissue size, homeostasis and cancer. We have demonstrated that Hippo signaling can be a very potent regulator of organ size in mice and have provided a conceptual link between organ size regulation and stem cell activity through Hippo signals. Studies are now aimed at fully dissecting the components and the role of this cascade in somatic stem cells. Insight into these processes will shed light on fundamental aspects of tissue regeneration and will facilitate the development of therapeutic approaches based on cellular transplantation. Additionally, our group is investigating the relevance of organ size regulatory mechanisms as new components of a tumor suppressor pathway.nnOur laboratory also has a strong interest in studying the cellular and molecular biology of hematopoietic stem cells. Our studies focus primarily on the in vivo roles of transcription factors and microRNAs in stem cell fate decisions, differentiation, and malignancy. We have recently developed a method for the tracking and monitoring of individual hematopoietic stem cells and their progeny in vivo. This model will be an invaluable resource in the years to come to understand the behavior, dynamics and heterogeneity of stem cells in normal and an array of disease conditions.'),
('Chien Laboratory', 'The Chien Laboratory focuses on the molecular pathways of cardiac development and heart disease, and has published in journals including Cell, Nature, and Science. Most recently, the laboratory discovered the ''progenitor cells'' (similar to stem cells) residing in the heart. The discovery of these cells signals a particularly exciting breakthrough, as they are capable of generating functioning heart muscle cells. Recently, the Chien lab also discovered a ''master'' cardiovascular stem cell that can give rise to all three major cell types in the heart - cardiac, smooth muscle, and endothelial - and is implicated in formation of heart muscle, the heart pacemaker system, and the coronary arteries. Since this master cardiovascular stem cell can be cloned from embryonic stem cells, this new finding has significant implications both for the study of heart development, drug discovery, and disease target identification, and for longer term potential therapeutic application of the cells in the repair and replacement of damaged heart, pacemaker, and vascular tissue.'),
('Cowan Laboratory', 'Our goal is to understand how naturally occurring human genetic variation protects (or predisposes) some people to cardiovascular and metabolic disease-the leading cause of death in the world-and to use that information to develop therapies that can protect the entire population from disease. Our strategy is to identify patients, families, and cohorts with disease; to use genetic techniques such as genome-wide association studies and exome sequencing to identify novel DNA variants and genes linked to disease; to use human cell-based models and mouse models to understand how the DNA variants affect gene and protein function; and to use these mechanistic insights to begin the process of developing new therapies that will benefit patients and populations. In particular, we are interested in using human pluripotent stem cells to create human-derived tissues, containing specific DNA variants, as genetic disease models in which environmental and epigenetic influences have been minimized. We also aim to use stem cells to enable regenerative medicine, in which a patient''s own cells can be genetically cured or made resistant to disease and then transplanted back into the body as a durable treatment.'),
('Eggan Laboratory', 'Our research is focused on understanding the contribution of environmental and genetic factors in the development of disease. The relative impact of these factors to pathogenesis is not well understood for many disorders. Complex interactions between genes and the environment have made it particularly difficult to develop accurate models for the sporadic and so called multifactorial forms of human disease. To further complicate studies, biopsied tissue containing the affected cell type is often extremely limited. Moreover, the developmental or pathological events leading to the disease have usually occurred long before diagnosis. While animal models exist for several diseases, they usually represent a rare, ''single-hit'', genetic form of a disease that may not completely or accurately reflect the human disorder nor recapitulate the influence of environmental factors in the development of the pathological state. As a result, it has been extremely difficult to discern the contribution of either genetic or environmental factors in the development of the more common complex diseases, such as type-1 diabetes, Parkinsons and cardiovascular disease. To help overcome these technical difficulties and expand our understanding of these and other complex diseases we are building in vitro models using human embryonic stem cells, in which genetic and developmental aspects of the disease can be controlled.'),
('Hochedlinger Laboratory', 'Our lab tries to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying pluripotency and nuclear reprogramming. Pluripotency denotes the ability of cells, such as embryonic stem (ES) cells, to give rise to all cell types of the mammalian body, while nuclear reprogramming is the dedifferentiation of a specialized cell back into a pluripotent state. Reprogramming does not normally occur in vivo but can be achieved experimentally by nuclear transfer, ES cell-somatic cell fusion and by directly inducing embryonic genes in somatic cells, generating so-called induced pluripotent (iPS) stem cells.nnWe are studying these processes functionally by establishing transgenic and knock-out mice and by manipulating murine and human ES cells. Combined with genome-wide approaches including RNAi and chemical screening we aim to dissect the mechanisms of pluripotency and epigenetic reprogramming. Ultimately, we hope that our research will aid in attempts to generate custom-tailored cells for treating and understanding disease through manipulation of defined genes and pathways.'),
('Hyman Laboratory', 'For the academic year 2011-2012 I am on sabbatical at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT with the goal of identifying new research directions after completing a decade as Harvard University Provost.  As Provost I served as Harvard''s chief academic officer, but had a special focus on the development of collaborative scientific initiatives that span multiple disciplines, that crossed the boundaries of Harvard''s schools and affiliated hospitals, and that extended to neighboring universities.  Previously my lab had studied intracellular signaling and regulation of gene expression within brain dopamine systems. Currently I am focused on ways of exploiting the emerging genetics of neuropsychiatric disorders to develop models that will ultimately facilitate the discovery of much needed new therapeutics. nnFrom 1996 to 2001, I served as Director of the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the component of the NIH charged with generating the knowledge needed to understand and treat mental illness.  At NIMH I emphasized investment in basic neuroscience and in the tools needed to analyze genetically complex disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.  '),
('Macklis Laboratory', 'Our laboratory is directed toward both 1) understanding the molecular controls over neuron sub-type specification and development in the cerebral cortex, and 2) applying developmental controls toward brain and spinal cord repair-specifically, the cellular repair of complex cerebral cortex and cortical output circuitry (in particular, cortico-spinal motor neuron (CSMN) circuitry that degenerates in ALS and other "upper motor neuron" degenerative diseases, and whose injury is centrally involved in loss of motor function in spinal cord injury).nnWe focus on neocortical projection neuron development and sub-type specification; neural progenitor / "stem cell" biology; induction of adult neurogenesis (the birth of new neurons from within); and directed neuronal differentiation and development of connectivity via molecular manipulation of neural progenitors within murine neocortex. The same biology informs understanding of neuronal subtype specificity of involvement in human neurodegenerative and developmental diseases, in particular ALS / motor neuron disease, PLS, HSPs, Huntington''s disease, autism spectrum disorders, and Rett Syndrome.nnWelcome to the Macklis Lab at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts!'),
('McMahon Laboratory', 'Research in our laboratory focuses on two major mammalian organ systems, the central nervous system and kidney. In the developing nervous system, Sonic hedgehog acts as a morphogen to induce distinct neural identities throughout the ventral part of the neural tube. Our interest lies in determining how a robust ligand-based signaling process is generated, modulated and maintained within the neural target field and how the transcriptional output of this pathway contributes to the formation of a functional nervous system.'),
('Meissner Laboratory', 'Our laboratory is a mixed group of experimental and computational biologists in the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology (HSCRB).  We use genomic tools to study developmental and stem cell biology with a particular interest in the role of epigenetic regulation (Mikkelsen et al. Nature 2008; Koche, Smith et al. Cell Stem Cell 2011). The term epigenetic refers to stable modifications of the chromatin and DNA that do not alter the primary nucleotide sequence. The global epigenetic makeup of a cell is a powerful indicator of its developmental state and potential. We have pioneered next generation sequencing technologies (Meissner et al. Nature 2008; Gu et al. Nature Methods 2010; Bock et al. Nature Biotechnology 2010) to study the epigenome in normal development and disease.nnOur lab has also continued to provide important mechanistic insights into the generation of iPS cells using genomic (Mikkelsen et al. Nature 2008; Koche, Smith et al. Cell Stem Cell 2011; Bock et al. Cell 2011) and single cell imaging (Smith et al. Nature Biotechnology 2010) tools. Over the last years we have accumulated tremendous insights of the process and build many essential tools. Combined with our genomic expertise we are in a unique position to expand these studies to have a broad impact on regenerative medicine and make major contributions to our general understanding of cell states.'),
('Melton Laboratory', 'We study the developmental biology of the pancreas with a view to finding new treatments for diabetes. Our aim is to understand how the pancreas develops and use that information to grow and develop new pancreatic cells (Islets of Langerhans). This project is an example of the larger question of how vertebrates make an organ from undifferentiated embryonic cells.nnOur experimental approaches use the tools of molecular, cellular and chemical biology to investigate how precursor or stem cells give rise to the pancreas and how pancreatic tissue is maintained in adults.   This includes identifying cells and gene products that specify developmental fates and physiological functions during organogenesis, regeneration, and following autoimmune attack. We use a variety of techniques including functional genomics, chemical screening, tissue explants and grafting. While we use several vertebrate organisms, including frogs, chickens, and axolotls, the main thrust of our work is done with human stem cells, both embryonic and iPS cells, as well as their mouse counterparts.nnDirecting cells to form new pancreatic tissue has a practical significance: if our studies are successful, it should be possible to apply our conclusions to human cells and provide a source of insulin-producing beta-cells for diabetics.'),

('Rinn Laboratory', 'Our research aims to understand the role of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) in establishing the distinct epigenetic states of adult and embryonic cells and their misregulation in diseases such as cancer. To further explore how lincRNAs may define and or drive cell fate decisions we developed computational methods to provide initial hypothesis of their functions. This "guilt by association method" pointed to a clear connection of lincRNAs and numerous cellular pathways ranging from pluripotency, cancer, adipogenesis to parasitology. We have employed systematic computational and experimental approaches that have unraveled a myriad of functional roles for lincRNAs in these pathways. Collectively our studies point to key regulatory roles for lincRNAs across diverse biological pathways, with a common theme of forming ribonucleic-protein complexes that in turn modulate cell fate decisions.'),
('Rossi Laboratory', 'Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are the only cells within the bone marrow that possess the ability to both differentiate to all blood lineages, and to self-renew for life. These properties, along with the remarkable ability of HSCs to engraft conditioned recipients upon intravenous transplantation, have established the clinical paradigm for stem cell use in regenerative medicine. However, despite the enormous clinical potential of HSCs, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms that regulate their fundamental properties of self-renewal and multi-potency. Our lab has a profound interest in understanding the mechanisms enabling self-renewal and multi-potency in HSCs, which we study using cellular, molecular, genetic and epigenetic approaches. nnOur lab is also interested in understanding the extent to which the aging of the stem cell compartment contributes to the pathophysiological conditions arising in the aged hematopoietic system. To address this we are evaluating HSCs in the context of aging in order to elucidate the mechanistic basis for HSC decline. In particular we are exploring the contribution of epigenetic dysregulation to HSC aging. We are also studying the mechanisms through which stem cells maintain genomic integrity, and examining how age-dependent DNA damage accrual impacts stem cell functional capacity. nnNumerous studies have shown that it is possible to experimentally reprogram the cellular identity of one cell type to another. One approach to effect cellular reprogramming involves enforcing expression of defined transcriptional regulators important for specifying one cell type in a different cell type in order to convert its fate. This methodology is perhaps best exemplified by the generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from a variety of differentiated cell types by the ectopic expression of a small number of defined factors. This approach is also proving to be a viable method to reprogram a variety of cell types to alternative fates. Our lab is pursuing several lines of investigation aimed at reprogramming the cellular identity of a number of cell types into clinically useful cell types, including HSCs, by using various approaches including the use of powerful technologies developed in the lab.

We have established an extensive range of complex image based assays that have been used to probe various properties of stem cells and of many cells derived from them. To accomplish this we use automated high content screening imagers, associated robotic equipment, and selected small molecule libraries. We combine our high throughput approach with detailed molecular studies to further our understanding of the mechanisms of disease and determine which compounds are most likely to be of therapeutic value.nnA primary focus of the lab is diseases of motor neuron degeneration, including spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and amyotrophic lateral scleroris (ALS).  SMA is genetic disorder caused by the decrease in the level of Survival of Motor Neuron protein (SMN) leading to neuromuscular degeneration in children. We have carried out quantitative high content measurements in patient fibroblasts to discover small molecules that increase the level of SMN. (Makhortova et al. Nature Chemical Biology, 2011). Prolonging motor neuron survival is a major therapeutic goal for treatment of both SMA and ALS. We have executed a variety of survival assays using motor neurons generated in large numbers from mouse and human ES cells as well as patient derived iPS cells to identify compounds that prevent motor neuron death.nnAnother important aim of our lab is to develop new stem cell based disease models using small molecule screens.  One project has applied this approach to improve the differentiation of stem cell derived dopaminergic neurons, the same cell type that is specifically lost in Parkinson''s disease. We are also working to identify small molecules that enhance transdifferentiation, which is the direct conversion of one differentiated cell type into another. nnOur expertise in developing stem cell based disease models and high content screening allows us to contribute to a large number of collaborations with members of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.'),

('Wagers Laboratory', 'Effective functioning of the body''s tissues and organs depends upon innate regenerative processes that maintain proper cell numbers (homeostasis) and replace damaged cells after injury (repair).  In many tissues, regenerative potential is determined by the presence and functionality of a dedicated population of stem and progenitor cells, which respond to exogenous cues to produce replacement cells when needed.  Understanding how these unspecialized precursors are maintained and regulated is essential for understanding the fundamental biology of tissues.  In addition, this knowledge has practical implications, as the regenerative potential of tissue-specific stem and progenitor cells can be exploited therapeutically by transplantation (to replenish the stem cell pool) or by endogenous manipulation (to boost the repair activity of cells already present in the tissue). nnWork in my laboratory focuses on uncovering the intrinsic and extrinsic regulators of stem cell function, and revealing how changes in stem cell activity impact tissue regeneration throughout life. Our studies have identified novel regulators of stem cell trafficking, including the transcription factor EGR1, which uniquely co-ordinates the migration and proliferation of blood stem cells in order to maintain appropriate stem cell number in the bone marrow and to support peripheral immune and inflammatory responses. We also developed and applied marker-based cell sorting approaches to analyze precursor cells in skeletal muscle, and identified a subset of satellite cells (mononuclear cells found beneath the basal lamina surrounding mature muscle fibers) that act as muscle stem cells. We demonstrated that these unique stem cells exhibit robust self-renewal and myogenic differentiation activity, and can restore muscle function when transplanted into injured or diseased muscle.nnWe now are exploiting these systems to uncover the cellular and molecular processes that underlie the stem cell dysfunction that typically arises with advancing age and that can promote tumor development.  Exciting new data from our studies suggests that stem cell aging is controlled at least in part by blood-borne mediators, which change with age and can be manipulated to reverse age-associated dysfunction.  Our future work will use the new insights gained from these studies to enable novel interventions to delay or reverse the onset of age-related disease and extend the healthful life of aging individuals.'),

The ability to convert one cell to anther provides powerful research tools to study the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms that govern cell identity and function in vivo.  Cells that gained new functions through reprogramming can be applied to treat injury and degenerative diseases in situ.  We are currently focused on two major models: The reprogramming of diverse endodermal cell types into insulin- secreting beta cells; the conversion of adult brain glial cells into a more juvenile form that strongly supports neuronal regeneration.

('Zon Laboratory', 'Dr. Leonard Zon''s laboratory focuses on the developmental biology of hematopoiesis and cancer. Over the past five years, we have collected over 30 mutants affecting the hematopoietic system. Some of the mutants represent excellent animal models of human disease. For instance, the isolation of the ferroportin iron transporter was based on a mutant zebrafish and subsequently was shown to be mutated in patients with iron overload disorders. The mutants also represent interesting key regulatory steps in the development of stem cells. Recently, a mutant was found that lacked blood stem cells and the mutated gene proved to be a caudal related homeoprotein called, CDX4. A Cdx-hox pathway was found to participate in early hematopoietic stem cell development and overexpression of CDX4 leads to ectopic blood development, within the zebrafish embryo and in mouse embryonic stem cells. We recently have developed hematopoietic cell transplantation for the zebrafish using blood cells labeled with green fluorescent protein and DSred. We were able to image the hematopoietic cells as they migrate to the marrow and to the thymus.nnThe laboratory has also developed zebrafish models of cancer. A screen for cell cycle mutants found 19 mutants. Some of these mutants get cancer at a very high rate as heterozygotes based on a carcinogenesis assay. The mutant genes appear to be new cancer genes and we have used small molecules in a chemical suppressor gene to find chemicals that bypass the mutant cell cycle problem. We also have generated a melanoma model in the zebrafish system using transgenics. Transgenic fish get nevi, and in a combination with a p53 mutant fish develop melanomas.'),

('Kaxiras Lab', 'The behavior of a material - whether the propagation of a crack in a turbine blade or the speed of an electronic switch - is determined by the interaction between valence electrons and ions in a solid. Real solids cannot be described as ideal infinite crystals because they contain many defects (such as surfaces, interfaces, grain boundaries, stacking faults, dislocations, vacancies, interstitials, and so on) whose presence can dramatically affect the properties of a material. Since the 1980s, physicists have developed a theoretical framework for studying the nature and properties of solids, using a quantum mechanical description that does not rely on adjustable parameters. Advances in computational power have made it possible to use this approach for describing realistic solids, including their defects, with remarkable accuracy - even to predict properties of novel materials not yet synthesized in the laboratory.nnEfthimios Kaxiras and his coworkers use these theoretical methods to study the properties of solids (including, for example, materials assembled from exotic carbon fullerenes), surfaces, and interfaces. They also employ them to explain the microscopic reasons for ductile or brittle behavior. In recent work, they have applied them, in combination with other techniques, to semiconductor crystal growth and other nonequilibrium phenomena. First, they calculate a few key quantities, such as diffusion and exchange barriers, using the quantum mechanical approach. They then use these quantities in more elaborate, stochastic (Monte Carlo) simulations that make direct contact with experiment.nnKaxiras has used this approach to unravel the features of complex dynamical phenomena such as surfactant-mediated hetero-epitaxial growth of semiconductors. Their analysis correctly reproduces growth instabilities, including the transition from layer-by-layer to island growth, and more detailed microscopic features, such as the fractal nature of islands and their size distribution during growth.'),

('Levine Lab', 'The development, homeostasis and evolution of organisms are highly complex phenomena that span many scales of time and space. Cellular components (such as genes and proteins) strongly interact with each other to process information to execute developmental programs and robust response to their environment. One approach we take is to study quantitatively small subsets of components  and the interactions among them. We aim to characterize the elementary building blocks of cellular networks, understand their functions and  limitations, and derive design principles. In particular, our lab is interested in the combined action of different modes of regulation, such as global and specific, transcriptional and post-transcrptional, etc.nnHowever, many biological processes are not limited to a small subset of interactions, and are better described as collective phenomena.  We thus need to complement our studies with a more global, phenomenological or statistical, approach. To bridge the gap between small circuits and collective behavior, we will focus on the way by which cells assume different roles and different states in a multi-cellular community. These may be bacterial cells in a community structure or in an animal host, germ cells in the gonads of a worm (the roundworm C. elegans), or adult cells in a regenerating animal (the flatworm S. mediterranea).nnOur studies combine theoretical approaches (deriving from statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics and dynamical systems) with experimental methods of molecular biology, imaging, and large-scale approaches.'),

For most of these experiments we use colloids, suspensions of particles typically about a micrometer in size. Because these particles are small enough to be buffeted about by Brownian motion, yet large enough that their motion is directly visible, they are extremely useful: they can be used as tracers to probe the internal dynamics of networks and fluids, as ''handles'' that can be attached to proteins and DNA so that these molecules can be manipulated with optical tweezers, and as generic model systems for understanding how random motion transforms disorder to order.'),

('Sachdev Lab', 'Quantum mechanics was originally developed by Schroedinger and Heisenberg as a theory of non-relativistic charged particles interacting via the Coulomb force, and successfully applied to a simple two-particle system like the hydrogen atom. However, among its most important applications has been the description of 1023 particles found in macroscopic matter. The earliest example of this was the Sommerfeld-Bloch theory of electronic motion in metals, and its refined formulation in Landau''s Fermi liquid theory. Although solving Schroedinger''s wave equation for 1023 interacting electrons appears an impossibly daunting task, Landau outlined a powerful strategy, involving the concept of ''quasiparticles'', which allowed an essentially exact description of the low temperature properties of metals. The quasiparticles have an essentially free electron-like character. Although interactions between the electrons do strongly renormalize various parameters in the effective Hamiltonian, the quantum dynamics of the quasiparticles is essentially that of nearly free electrons, each of which can be described independently by single-particle quantum mechanics.nnSince the mid-80''s, much attention has been lavished on a variety of transition metal compounds, whose physical properties do not fit easily into the Landau paradiagm. The most important among these compounds are ceramics, like YBa2Cu3O7, in which the electronic motion occurs primarily in two-dimensional CuO2 layers, and which display high temperature superconductivity. It is clear that electron-electron interactions are playing a much more fundamental role here, and the excitations are qualitatively different from individual electrons.nnSubir Sachdev''s research has focused on the classification of the many-body ground states of interacting electrons, especially in two spatial dimensions. Fundamental distinctions between such ground states imply that they cannot be smoothly connected to each other (whereas the Landau Fermi liquid is smoothly connected to the independent electron state). Such states are necessarily separated by quantum phase transitions at a quantum critical point (QCP). The QCP has novel properties and usually does not permit a quasiparticle description. Although the QCP is only a special point in the zero temperature phase diagram, it turns out to be a useful point of departure for understanding the physical properties of phases in its vicinity both at zero and non-zero temperatures. Remarkably, it is often the case that quantum mechanics is crucial to understanding the collective properties of 1023 electrons in these materials, even at temperatures as high as room temperature and at the longest time and distance scales.'),
('Samuel Lab', 'Animals are intrinsically computational.

Thus simple and well-chosen model organisms can be accessible vantage points with perspective over general biological principles. We study brain and behavior in the roundworm C. elegans. The worm only has 302 neurons, but is capable of a variety of behaviors that display a range of computational powers. We focus specifically on navigational behaviors to physical sensory inputs. Physical sensory inputs can be delivered to the behaving worm both reliably and quantifiably.

('Silvera Lab', 'Isaac Silvera''s research is in both condensed matter and physics of cold particles. His interests are in ultra high pressure and low-temperature physics of quantum fluids.nnWigner and Huntington predicted, over 70 years ago, that under high pressure solid molecular hydrogen would become an atomic metal.  Theoretical predictions that it might be a liquid at high pressure, a room temperature two-component superconductor, superfluidity, etc. have spurred the effort to produce this in the laboratory. Our high-pressure physics uses diamond anvil cells to compress samples to pressures approaching 3 megabar. The focus is on hydrogen and its isotopes, with an effort to produce and study metallic hydrogen. The low-pressure molecular hydrogen isotopes undergo a number of phase transitions as pressure is increased. New phases of orientational order called the broken symmetry phase and an as yet uncharacterized phase called the hydrogen-A phase above 1.5 megabar have been discovered. Techniques involve Raman scattering, IR spectroscopy, pulsed laser heating, NMR, equation of state measurements, conductivity, synchrotron x-ray studies, etc. Recent developments in the area of pulsed laser heating of samples use short, high power pulses at infrared wavelengths; samples can be heated to several thousand degrees K. A peak in the melting line as a function of pressure that we found is a possible precursor of liquid atomic metallic hydrogen.nnAn effort is underway is to stabilize and study multi-electron bubbles  (MEBs) in superfluid helium. These are spherical bubbles containing from 2 to of order 108 electrons and have diameters of tens of nanometers to hundreds of microns. Due to Coulomb repulsion the electrons reside on the surface of the bubble in helium and form a two-dimensional gas. Extremely high surface densities are predicted. In current experiments MEBs have been observed with high-speed photography. Experiments are being designed to trap MEBs with EM fields, to visually observe static bubbles and measure some of their properties. At high enough density or low temperature the electron gas is expected to form a Wigner lattice, and at still higher densities the lattice is predicted to quantum melt due to increasing zero-point motion. Bubbles have dynamic modes of oscillation (spherical ripplons), high frequency plasma modes, etc. Superconductivity has been predicted on a BCS model with electron-ripplon coupling and is within access of experiment.'),
('Strominger Lab', 'The fundamental laws of nature, as we currently understand them, are both incomplete and self-contradictory. Unsolved problems include the unification of forces and particles, the origin of the universe and the quantum structure of black holes and event horizons. Professor Strominger''s research has endeavored to shed light on these problems using a variety of approaches. The emergence of string theory as a potential unified theory of nature began with Strominger''s co-discovery of Calabi-Yau compactifications. This construction demonstrated that string theory not only reconciles quantum mechanics and gravity, but can also contain within it electrons, protons, photons and all the other observed particles and forces, and hence is a viable candidate for a complete unified theory of nature. Strominger co-discovered the brane solutions of string theory, and subsequently used them to unravel the intricate and beautiful duality symmetries of the theory. The branes were eventually used by Strominger and collaborators to give a microscopic demonstration of how black holes are able to holographically store information; resolving a deep paradox uncovered by Hawking and Bekenstein a quarter century earlier. He and coworkers also used the branes to derive new relations in algebraic geometry, equating the moduli space of a brane in a Calabi-Yau space to the mirror Calabi-Yau4, and relating the Donaldson-Thomas to the Gromov-Witten invariants.nnStrominger''s recent research has focused on universal aspects of black holes and horizons, which do not depend on detailed microphysical assumptions. A new conformal symmetry of rapidly spinning black holes was discovered and used to explain how they holographically store quantum information. Strominger and coworkers found a mathematically precise mathematical relation between the Navier-Stokes and Einstein equation, demonstrating that horizons evolve as incompressible fluids and providing a bridge between fluid dynamics and general relativity.

('Vafa Lab', 'Cumrun Vafa''s primary area of research is string theory.  String theory, a subject that is about four decades old, is at the center of efforts by theoretical physicists to find a unified fundamental theory of nature.  String theory provides a framework to unify everything we know about nature, including all particles and the forces between them, in a consistent quantum theory.  This is an ambitious goal, given that it aims to describe physical phenomena involving scales 10^25 times smaller than the atom, as well as the cosmology of our entire universe, which involves a scale of about 10^37 times bigger than the atom. In a single theory, one studies the mysteries of confinement of quarks inside atomic nuclei, as well as enigmatic properties of astrophysical objects such as black holes.nnSuch an all-encompassing theory necessarily requires a tremendous amount of mathematical technology.  In fact, most of the mathematics needed for string theory is not even yet developed.  String theorists thus have the exciting task of building new mathematics as tools to explore new laws of physics. It is therefore not surprising that string theory is at the cross roads of many fields, including mathematics, particle phenomenology and astrophysics. Cumrun Vafa''s research has involved essentially all these aspects.  Together with his colleagues he has worked on topological strings, trying to elucidate some new mathematics originating from string theory (notably in his work on mirror symmetry) and using these techniques to uncover some of the mysteries of black holes, particularly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.  He has also applied these ideas to particle theories by geometrically engineering quantum field theories, as well as solving the strong coupling dynamics of confining theories (using large N matrix model technology) and geometrizing string theory defects (in a limit of string theory known as F-theory).  His recent work involves applying these ideas to come up with stringy predictions about what the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN may potentially discover in the near future.'),
('Walsworth Lab', 'Ron Walsworth leads an interdisciplinary research group with a focus on developing precision measurement tools and applying them to important problems in both the physical and life sciences: from AMO physics, astrophysics and nanoscience to bioimaging, brain science and medical diagnostics. nnCurrent areas of research include: nanoscale magnetometry and spin physics with Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond; the use of laser frequency combs as improved optical wavelength calibrators for astrophysics, with applications to the search for Earth-like exoplanets; precision tests of fundamental physical laws and symmetries using maser atomic clocks; super-resolution optical imaging and functionalized electron microscopy for brain science and other bioimaging applications; and the development of novel NMR and MRI tools, with applications to basic spin physics and medical imaging.

('Weitz Lab', 'David Weitz''s group studies the physics of soft condensed matter, materials which are easily deformed by external stresses, electric, magnetic or gravitational fields, or even by thermal fluctuations. These materials typically possess structures which are much larger than atomic or molecular scales; the structure and dynamics at the mesoscopic scales determine macroscopic physical properties. The goal of this research is to probe and understand the relationship between mesoscopic structure and bulk properties. We study both synthetic and biological materials; our interests extend from fundamental physics to technological applications, from basic materials questions to specific biological problems. The techniques we use include video image analysis, light scattering, optical microscopy, rheology, and laser tweezing. We also develop new techniques to study these materials; we pioneered the use of multiple scattered waves to study dynamics and mechanical properties of materials, and applied these optical methods to measure the rheological properties of materials in what is now called microrheology.nnThere are currently three major research themes in the group. The first is colloid physics, which includes the study of colloidal particles as models systems for the study of materials. We investigatge the growth and dynamics of colloidal crystals, glasses and gels; light scattering and confocal microscopy are combined to probe both structure and dynamics of these materials. We investigate the structure and properties of glasses and gels formed with attractive interactions, and search for the universal behavior that can describe such disordered structures. This work is motivated both by fundamental interest and important applications of these systems to create novel structures and to model the properties of materials.nnA second major theme is biophysics. We focus on the mechanical properties of cells, and develop new methods to probe these properties. We use purified proteins to form reconstituted biopolymer networks, and study rheological properties of these systems. By incorporating molecular motors into these networks, we study the properties of highly non-equilibrium, active materials, and develop models to describe the properties of such materials. We apply the insight gained from these model systems to investigate the mechanical behavior of cells.nnThe third major theme is microfluidics, where our focus is on the use of multiphase fluid flow to create, control and use emulsions with microfluidic devices. We engineer novel structures made from colloids, polymers or lipids that can be used to encapsulate materials. These structures are formed from multiple emulsions which are controllably produced with microfluidic devices. In addition, we are developing microfluidic devices that use individual droplets as microreactors, with volumes as small as femtoliters. The precise control over these droplets afforded by the microfluidic devices enables us to use them as reaction vessels for very high throughput studies of biological reactions. We are developing methods to improve the functionality of enzymes through directed evolution of their function, and to study the properties of large populations of individual cells encapsulated within the droplets.nnOur work spans fundamental science to direct applications. Many projects are carried out in collaboration with industry; we do the fundamental science that also addresses important technological questions. In addition, some of our work is spun out into start-up companies, providing alternate career opportunities.'),
('Westervelt Lab', 'Robert Westervelt received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1977. Following a postdoctoral appointment at Berkeley, he moved to Harvard University, where he is currently Mallinckrodt Professor of Applied Physics & Physics, and Professor of Physics.  He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society.nnWestervelt''s group investigates the quantum behavior of electrons inside nanoscale semiconductor structures, and develops tools for the manipulation of biological systems.nnIn mesoscopic physics, the group has developed liquid-helium cooled scanning probe microscopes that can image electron motion through nanoscale devices.  They visualized the flow of electron waves through a two-dimensional electron gas (Topinka et al. 2003) and observed diffraction patterns and coherent interference (LeRoy et al. 2005), as well as cyclotron orbits in a magnetic field (Aidala et al. 2007).  They have used the conducting tip as a movable gate to control a one-electron quantum dot formed in a semiconductor nanowire (Bleszynski et al. 2008) and a GaAs heterostructure (Fallahi et al. 2005). In related research, they have developed tunnel-coupled quantum dots and studied their behavior as artificial molecules (Livermore et al. 2006, Vidan et al. 2006) and tested Josephson junctions formed in Ge/Si nanowires (Xiang et al. 2006).nnOn the biophysics side, Westervelt''s group has developed hybrid Integrated Circuit / Microfluidic chips that combine the power of CMOS technology with the biocompatibility of microfluidics (Lee, Ham & Westervelt, 2007, Hunt et al. 2008).  These devices act as programmable microfluidic systems that can trap, move, sort, and assemble biological cells and small particles in fluids.nnRobert Westervelt is Director of the NSF-funded Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center, Science of Nanoscale Systems and their Device Applications, which is basedat Harvard University and includes participants at MIT, UC Santa Barbara and the Museum of Science, Boston.  Previously Westervelt served as Director of the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center and as Co-Director of the Joint Services Electronics Program, both at Harvard.'),
('Wilson Lab', 'Richard Wilson has worked on a variety of projects in his 50-year career in nuclear and particle physics and more recently in various topics in Risk assessment and Risk-Benefit Analysis. nnStarting with nucleon scattering, he has more recently worked on scattering of leptons, both electrons and muons, by nucleons.   Then on  electron- positron colliding beams firstly at Harvard (CEA) from 1970-73, then at Cornell University, (CLEO project) until 2001.   He is still working on two smaller activities: experiment (HAPPEX) with scattering of polarized electrons by protons at the CEBAF (JLAB) in Virginia, to search for strange quark form factors, and on ''little a'' in neutron decay at Indiana and NIST in Maryland.     Richard Wilson presently works on Risk-Benefit Analysis, and on cancer incidence at old age (>80years).'),
('Wu Lab', 'Tai Tsun Wu''s research includes projects in high-energy particle physics, statistical mechanics, classical electromagnetic theory, and quantum information processing. He has a long-standing interest in the theory of very-high-energy collisions. Some of his unexpected predictions, such as the increasing total cross sections, have been verified experimentally at the CERN proton-antiproton Collider and the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. Recent efforts have been concentrated on understanding production processes for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) being built at CERN and scheduled to become operational in September of 2007. One especially important process is the theoretical prediction for the production cross section of a Higgs particle with low momentum together with two forward jets. In statistical mechanics, Wu''s work is mostly on Bose-Einstein condensation in an external potential. In recent years, there has been a groundswell of interest in the general notion of applying quantum mechanics to advanced computing and communication. Appropriate for groundbreaking conceptual work, the models used to arouse interest in quantum computing and secure quantum communication have been the simplest possible. In particular, most of the early work was based on the Schr'),
('Yacoby  Lab', 'Professor Yacoby is an experimental condensed matter physicist. His current research interests are focused at unraveling the underlying phenomena governing low dimensional systems. Starting with two dimensional electron systems, the group uses novel scan probe techniques that are capable of detecting electric charge with a resolution of 10 -4 of one electron and spatial resolution of 100nm. This technique enables them to image the distribution of electrons and the way they localize in space in various material systems such as GaAs or single monolayers of graphite as well as under various ground state conditions such as the integer and fractional quantum Hall effect. Of particular interest is the 5/2 fractional quantum Hall ground state where the elementary excitations carry a fractional charge of e/4 and obey non-Abelian statistics. Such a system is a model system for topological quantum computation.nnReducing dimensionality further to one dimension opens up a fascinating world where electrical conduction is strongly governed by the interaction between electrons. Here the group explores experimentally Luttinger liquid behavior whose strongest manifestation is the separation of spin and charge of the elementary excitations.nnFinally going down to zero dimensional systems, know as quantum dots, the group studies various approaches to storing and manipulating quantum information using the spin of individual electrons.'),
('Yelin Lab', 'Susanne Yelin''s research interests are in theoretical quantum optics and quantum information science. Current research directions include quantum control of ultracold polar molecules, investigation of novel coherence-based optical elements, single-photon nonlinear optics using dipolar systems, coherent metamaterials and negative refractivity, coherent control in condensed matter systems, and superradiance.'),
('Yin Lab', 'String theory, being our best hope for a complete description of quantum gravity and a unified theory of everything, also provides a powerful toolbox along the way for solving problems in seemingly very different subjects, such as strongly coupled quantum field theories, conformal field theory, integrable systems, algebraic geometry, hyperbolic geometry, etc. Xi Yin''s research interest lies in the fundamental aspects of string theory, and what string theory can teach us about other fields in physics and mathematics. Yin''s past works involve black holes [5], supersymmetric bound states in string theory [3,4], conformal field theory and gauge theory in three dimensions [2]. His current research focuses on quantum gravity in low dimensions (e.g. [1]), as well as the holographic duality between gauge theory and string theory/gravity (a.k.a. AdS/CFT correspondence).'),
