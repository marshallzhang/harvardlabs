       <p>Motile behavior of bacteria: flagellated bacteria
          possess a remarkable motility system based on a reversible
          rotary motor linked by a flexible coupling (the proximal
          hook) to a thin helical propeller (the flagellar filament).
          The motor derives its energy from protons driven into
          the cell by chemical gradients or electrical fields.
          The direction of the motor rotation depends in part
          on signals generated by sensory systems, of which the
          best studied analyzes chemical stimuli. Howard Berg&#8217;s
          research group is trying to learn how the motor works,
          the nature of the signal that controls the motor&#8217;s
          direction of rotation, and how this signal is processed
          by the chemical sensory system. The group is also studying
          non-flagellated bacteria that glide over solid surfaces
          by as yet unknown mechanisms. These questions are being
          approached by a variety of molecular-genetic and physical
          techniques, including fluorescence and fluorescence
          resonance energy transfer. The goal is an understanding
          of motility and sensory transduction at the molecular
          levels. </p>

        <p> Adam Cohen's research focuses on developing and applying new physical
tools to probe molecules and cells, with project ranging from quantum
mechanics to pure biology.  His lab developed a new class of
fluorescent protein indicators of membrane potential, which allow one
to visualize electrical dynamics in neurons, heart cells, and
bacteria.  He also discovered a new property of electromagnetic
fields, optical chirality, which determines the degree of chiral
selectivity in the interaction of light with chiral molecules.  He
invented an Anti-Brownian Electrokinetic trap (ABEL trap) capable of
trapping and manipulating individual fluorescent molecules in solution
at room temperature.  Part of the lab is now studying chemical
reactions whose outcome is exquisitely sensitive to small magnetic
fields--a consequence of quantum coherence in a room-temperature
liquid.</p>
        <p>Research in the Cohen Lab is unified by the search
          for ways to achieve precise control over the classical
          and quantum states of molecules, under conditions that
          are warm and wet and squishy. </p>
