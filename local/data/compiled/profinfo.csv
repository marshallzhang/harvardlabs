"Arlotta Laboratory","http://www.scrb.harvard.edu/faculty/lab/41/home","The genetic programs that control the differentiation of distinct types of neurons in the brain are still largely unknown. In our lab we address this issue in the cerebral cortex. Our main interest lies in investigating the mechanisms that govern the development of distinct subtypes of neurons of the neocortex, and in developing approaches to aid neuronal regeneration in the context of neurodegenerative and traumatic disease of the cortical output circuitry.\nAmong the different classes of cortical neurons, we are primarily interested in the signals that induce differentiation and regeneration of corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN), a clinically relevant neuronal population that in humans selectively degenerates in ALS (Lou Gehrig\'s disease), Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) and Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS), and is permanently injured in spinal cord injury (SCI)."
"Camargo Laboratory","http://www.scrb.harvard.edu/faculty/lab/42/home","The Camargo laboratory focuses on the study of adult stem cell biology, organ size regulation, and cancer.\n\nDespite fantastic progress in developmental biology research over the past decade, one aspect of development and tissue homeostasis for which very little is understood is how individual tissues reach and then maintain their appropriate size. Classic studies have demonstrated that tissues are able to \'sense\' their size and expand or shrink until a correct dimension has been reached. Nevertheless, the nature of the molecules and pathways involved in this process remain mysterious.\n\nOur laboratory utilizes a variety of genetic, biochemical, and high throughput technologies to identify molecules and mechanisms that regulate this fascinating process in mammals. We are particularly interested in studying the function of the newly discovered Hippo signaling pathway and its effects on tissue size, homeostasis and cancer. We have demonstrated that Hippo signaling can be a very potent regulator of organ size in mice and have provided a conceptual link between organ size regulation and stem cell activity through Hippo signals. Studies are now aimed at fully dissecting the components and the role of this cascade in somatic stem cells. Insight into these processes will shed light on fundamental aspects of tissue regeneration and will facilitate the development of therapeutic approaches based on cellular transplantation. Additionally, our group is investigating the relevance of organ size regulatory mechanisms as new components of a tumor suppressor pathway.\n\nOur laboratory also has a strong interest in studying the cellular and molecular biology of hematopoietic stem cells. Our studies focus primarily on the in vivo roles of transcription factors and microRNAs in stem cell fate decisions, differentiation, and malignancy. We have recently developed a method for the tracking and monitoring of individual hematopoietic stem cells and their progeny in vivo. This model will be an invaluable resource in the years to come to understand the behavior, dynamics and heterogeneity of stem cells in normal and an array of disease conditions."
"Chien Laboratory","http://www.scrb.harvard.edu/faculty/lab/47/home","The Chien Laboratory focuses on the molecular pathways of cardiac development and heart disease, and has published in journals including Cell, Nature, and Science. Most recently, the laboratory discovered the \'progenitor cells\' (similar to stem cells) residing in the heart. The discovery of these cells signals a particularly exciting breakthrough, as they are capable of generating functioning heart muscle cells. Recently, the Chien lab also discovered a \'master\' cardiovascular stem cell that can give rise to all three major cell types in the heart - cardiac, smooth muscle, and endothelial - and is implicated in formation of heart muscle, the heart pacemaker system, and the coronary arteries. Since this master cardiovascular stem cell can be cloned from embryonic stem cells, this new finding has significant implications both for the study of heart development, drug discovery, and disease target identification, and for longer term potential therapeutic application of the cells in the repair and replacement of damaged heart, pacemaker, and vascular tissue."
"Cowan Laboratory","http://www.scrb.harvard.edu/faculty/lab/43/home","Our goal is to understand how naturally occurring human genetic variation protects (or predisposes) some people to cardiovascular and metabolic disease-the leading cause of death in the world-and to use that information to develop therapies that can protect the entire population from disease. Our strategy is to identify patients, families, and cohorts with disease; to use genetic techniques such as genome-wide association studies and exome sequencing to identify novel DNA variants and genes linked to disease; to use human cell-based models and mouse models to understand how the DNA variants affect gene and protein function; and to use these mechanistic insights to begin the process of developing new therapies that will benefit patients and populations. In particular, we are interested in using human pluripotent stem cells to create human-derived tissues, containing specific DNA variants, as genetic disease models in which environmental and epigenetic influences have been minimized. We also aim to use stem cells to enable regenerative medicine, in which a patient\'s own cells can be genetically cured or made resistant to disease and then transplanted back into the body as a durable treatment."
"Eggan Laboratory","http://www.scrb.harvard.edu/faculty/lab/44/home","Our research is focused on understanding the contribution of environmental and genetic factors in the development of disease. The relative impact of these factors to pathogenesis is not well understood for many disorders. Complex interactions between genes and the environment have made it particularly difficult to develop accurate models for the sporadic and so called multifactorial forms of human disease. To further complicate studies, biopsied tissue containing the affected cell type is often extremely limited. Moreover, the developmental or pathological events leading to the disease have usually occurred long before diagnosis. While animal models exist for several diseases, they usually represent a rare, \'single-hit\', genetic form of a disease that may not completely or accurately reflect the human disorder nor recapitulate the influence of environmental factors in the development of the pathological state. As a result, it has been extremely difficult to discern the contribution of either genetic or environmental factors in the development of the more common complex diseases, such as type-1 diabetes, Parkinsons and cardiovascular disease. To help overcome these technical difficulties and expand our understanding of these and other complex diseases we are building in vitro models using human embryonic stem cells, in which genetic and developmental aspects of the disease can be controlled."
"Hochedlinger Laboratory","http://www.scrb.harvard.edu/faculty/lab/45/home","Our lab tries to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying pluripotency and nuclear reprogramming. Pluripotency denotes the ability of cells, such as embryonic stem (ES) cells, to give rise to all cell types of the mammalian body, while nuclear reprogramming is the dedifferentiation of a specialized cell back into a pluripotent state. Reprogramming does not normally occur in vivo but can be achieved experimentally by nuclear transfer, ES cell-somatic cell fusion and by directly inducing embryonic genes in somatic cells, generating so-called induced pluripotent (iPS) stem cells.\n\nWe are studying these processes functionally by establishing transgenic and knock-out mice and by manipulating murine and human ES cells. Combined with genome-wide approaches including RNAi and chemical screening we aim to dissect the mechanisms of pluripotency and epigenetic reprogramming. Ultimately, we hope that our research will aid in attempts to generate custom-tailored cells for treating and understanding disease through manipulation of defined genes and pathways."

This \"guilt by association method\" pointed to a clear connection of lincRNAs and numerous cellular pathways ranging from pluripotency, cancer, adipogenesis to parasitology. We have employed systematic computational and experimental approaches that have unraveled a myriad of functional roles for lincRNAs in these pathways.

"Rossi Laboratory","http://www.scrb.harvard.edu/faculty/lab/53/home","Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are the only cells within the bone marrow that possess the ability to both differentiate to all blood lineages, and to self-renew for life. These properties, along with the remarkable ability of HSCs to engraft conditioned recipients upon intravenous transplantation, have established the clinical paradigm for stem cell use in regenerative medicine. However, despite the enormous clinical potential of HSCs, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms that regulate their fundamental properties of self-renewal and multi-potency. Our lab has a profound interest in understanding the mechanisms enabling self-renewal and multi-potency in HSCs, which we study using cellular, molecular, genetic and epigenetic approaches. \n\nOur lab is also interested in understanding the extent to which the aging of the stem cell compartment contributes to the pathophysiological conditions arising in the aged hematopoietic system. To address this we are evaluating HSCs in the context of aging in order to elucidate the mechanistic basis for HSC decline. In particular we are exploring the contribution of epigenetic dysregulation to HSC aging. We are also studying the mechanisms through which stem cells maintain genomic integrity, and examining how age-dependent DNA damage accrual impacts stem cell functional capacity. \n\nNumerous studies have shown that it is possible to experimentally reprogram the cellular identity of one cell type to another. One approach to effect cellular reprogramming involves enforcing expression of defined transcriptional regulators important for specifying one cell type in a different cell type in order to convert its fate. This methodology is perhaps best exemplified by the generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from a variety of differentiated cell types by the ectopic expression of a small number of defined factors. This approach is also proving to be a viable method to reprogram a variety of cell types to alternative fates. Our lab is pursuing several lines of investigation aimed at reprogramming the cellular identity of a number of cell types into clinically useful cell types, including HSCs, by using various approaches including the use of powerful technologies developed in the lab.

"Rubin Laboratory","http://www.scrb.harvard.edu/faculty/lab/54/home","Our laboratory focuses on translational, high-throughput research to model disease and develop drugs using stem cells. We have established an extensive range of complex image based assays that have been used to probe various properties of stem cells and of many cells derived from them. To accomplish this we use automated high content screening imagers, associated robotic equipment, and selected small molecule libraries. We combine our high throughput approach with detailed molecular studies to further our understanding of the mechanisms of disease and determine which compounds are most likely to be of therapeutic value.\n\nA primary focus of the lab is diseases of motor neuron degeneration, including spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and amyotrophic lateral scleroris (ALS).  SMA is genetic disorder caused by the decrease in the level of Survival of Motor Neuron protein (SMN) leading to neuromuscular degeneration in children. We have carried out quantitative high content measurements in patient fibroblasts to discover small molecules that increase the level of SMN. (Makhortova et al. Nature Chemical Biology, 2011). Prolonging motor neuron survival is a major therapeutic goal for treatment of both SMA and ALS. We have executed a variety of survival assays using motor neurons generated in large numbers from mouse and human ES cells as well as patient derived iPS cells to identify compounds that prevent motor neuron death.\n\nAnother important aim of our lab is to develop new stem cell based disease models using small molecule screens.  One project has applied this approach to improve the differentiation of stem cell derived dopaminergic neurons, the same cell type that is specifically lost in Parkinson\'s disease. We are also working to identify small molecules that enhance transdifferentiation, which is the direct conversion of one differentiated cell type into another. \n\nOur expertise in developing stem cell based disease models and high content screening allows us to contribute to a large number of collaborations with members of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute."

"Wagers Laboratory","http://www.scrb.harvard.edu/faculty/lab/57/home","Effective functioning of the body\'s tissues and organs depends upon innate regenerative processes that maintain proper cell numbers (homeostasis) and replace damaged cells after injury (repair).  In many tissues, regenerative potential is determined by the presence and functionality of a dedicated population of stem and progenitor cells, which respond to exogenous cues to produce replacement cells when needed.  Understanding how these unspecialized precursors are maintained and regulated is essential for understanding the fundamental biology of tissues.  In addition, this knowledge has practical implications, as the regenerative potential of tissue-specific stem and progenitor cells can be exploited therapeutically by transplantation (to replenish the stem cell pool) or by endogenous manipulation (to boost the repair activity of cells already present in the tissue). \n\nWork in my laboratory focuses on uncovering the intrinsic and extrinsic regulators of stem cell function, and revealing how changes in stem cell activity impact tissue regeneration throughout life. Our studies have identified novel regulators of stem cell trafficking, including the transcription factor EGR1, which uniquely co-ordinates the migration and proliferation of blood stem cells in order to maintain appropriate stem cell number in the bone marrow and to support peripheral immune and inflammatory responses. We also developed and applied marker-based cell sorting approaches to analyze precursor cells in skeletal muscle, and identified a subset of satellite cells (mononuclear cells found beneath the basal lamina surrounding mature muscle fibers) that act as muscle stem cells. We demonstrated that these unique stem cells exhibit robust self-renewal and myogenic differentiation activity, and can restore muscle function when transplanted into injured or diseased muscle.\n\nWe now are exploiting these systems to uncover the cellular and molecular processes that underlie the stem cell dysfunction that typically arises with advancing age and that can promote tumor development.  Exciting new data from our studies suggests that stem cell aging is controlled at least in part by blood-borne mediators, which change with age and can be manipulated to reverse age-associated dysfunction.  Our future work will use the new insights gained from these studies to enable novel interventions to delay or reverse the onset of age-related disease and extend the healthful life of aging individuals."

The ability to convert one cell to anther provides powerful research tools to study the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms that govern cell identity and function in vivo.  Cells that gained new functions through reprogramming can be applied to treat injury and degenerative diseases in situ.  We are currently focused on two major models: The reprogramming of diverse endodermal cell types into insulin- secreting beta cells; the conversion of adult brain glial cells into a more juvenile form that strongly supports neuronal regeneration.

"Zon Laboratory","http://www.scrb.harvard.edu/faculty/lab/59/home","Dr. Leonard Zon\'s laboratory focuses on the developmental biology of hematopoiesis and cancer. Over the past five years, we have collected over 30 mutants affecting the hematopoietic system. Some of the mutants represent excellent animal models of human disease. For instance, the isolation of the ferroportin iron transporter was based on a mutant zebrafish and subsequently was shown to be mutated in patients with iron overload disorders. The mutants also represent interesting key regulatory steps in the development of stem cells. Recently, a mutant was found that lacked blood stem cells and the mutated gene proved to be a caudal related homeoprotein called, CDX4. A Cdx-hox pathway was found to participate in early hematopoietic stem cell development and overexpression of CDX4 leads to ectopic blood development, within the zebrafish embryo and in mouse embryonic stem cells. We recently have developed hematopoietic cell transplantation for the zebrafish using blood cells labeled with green fluorescent protein and DSred. We were able to image the hematopoietic cells as they migrate to the marrow and to the thymus.\n\nThe laboratory has also developed zebrafish models of cancer. A screen for cell cycle mutants found 19 mutants. Some of these mutants get cancer at a very high rate as heterozygotes based on a carcinogenesis assay. The mutant genes appear to be new cancer genes and we have used small molecules in a chemical suppressor gene to find chemicals that bypass the mutant cell cycle problem. We also have generated a melanoma model in the zebrafish system using transgenics. Transgenic fish get nevi, and in a combination with a p53 mutant fish develop melanomas."

"Gabrielse Lab","http://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/gabrielse.html","The Gabrielse research group enjoys a variety of atomic, optical, elementary particle, plasma and low temperature physics experiments. A one-electron quantum cyclotron has made it possible to measure the dimensionless electron magnetic moment 15 times more accurately than a measurement that stood for twenty years, and to determine the fine structure constant 20 times more accurately than does any independent method. A separate measurement, in collaboration with Prof. Doyle and Prof. DeMille (Yale), seeks a substantial improvement in measuring the electric dipole moment of the electron.  In addition, the most precise laser spectroscopy of helium fine structure intervals, stabilized by an iodine optical clock and an optical comb, provides a way to test two-electron QED. \n\nProfessor Gabrielse led the international TRAP team that developed the techniques to accumulate antiprotons at energies more than 1010 times lower than previously realized. This enabled the most stringent CPT test with baryons, made by comparing charge-to-mass ratios for a single antiproton and proton to an accuracy of 90 parts per trillion. The international ATRAP Collaboration, also led by Gabrielse, now uses these antiprotons to produce cold antihydrogen atoms, an important step towards comparing antihydrogen and hydrogen atoms via precise laser spectroscopy.

"Hau Lab","http://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/hau.html","Lene Hau\'s latest research has centered on cold atoms and Bose-Einstein condensation. Her group uses laser cooling to efficiently precool atoms to temperatures in the microkelvin regime. Subsequently, the atoms are trapped in a 4 Dee magnet and evaporatively cooled to nanokelvin temperatures, which results in the creation of Bose-Einstein condensates typically containing millions of atoms. The condensates are formed in an ultra high vacuum system constructed for easy access to and manipulation of cold atom clouds with light probes and mechanical structures. \n\nRecently, the Hau group succeeded in reducing the light speed to 17 m/s (the speed of a racing bicycle) by optically inducing a quantum interference in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Ultra slow light creates a unique, new tool for probing the fundamental properties of Bose-Einstein condensates. Examples are: coupling of light and sound, an atom laser with controllable, localized output coupling, and studies of the dynamical formation of condensates. The system also exhibits extreme optical properties: Hau\'s group has demonstrated a nonlinear refractive index which is 14 orders of magnitude larger that the nonlinear index in an optical fiber and the largest ever measured by a factor of a million. This has opened up a new territory of nonlinear optics at extremely low light levels, with interesting prospects for areas of quantum optics such as optical squeezing, quantum nondemolition, and studies of nonlocality. Intriguing potential applications of the large nonlinearities include creation of optical switches that work at the single photon level, dynamically programmable optical delay lines, and serial to parallel conversion. \n\nA practical system could possibly be based on atom cooling with the use of diode lasers and micro-traps relating to another of Hau\'s interests: atomic wave guides for cold atoms. Hau and collaborators were the first to suggest a wave-guide for cold atoms based on a mechanical structure. The suggested \'Kapitza guide\' involves dynamical stabilization of atom motion around a metallic wire with time varying electric potentials. The resulting atom dynamics is intriguing and coupled with Bose-Einstein condensates, the wave-guide offers a unique possibility for studying chaos in a many body, interacting system. Furthermore, a condensate could adiabatically be transferred from the 4 Dee magnet to the wave-guide states, leading to output coupling and transport of coherent atomic matter waves. The Kapitza guide can thus be regarded as the matter wave analogue of optical fibers used as guiding structures for coherent light."

"Kaxiras Lab","http://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/kaxiras.html","The behavior of a material - whether the propagation of a crack in a turbine blade or the speed of an electronic switch - is determined by the interaction between valence electrons and ions in a solid. Real solids cannot be described as ideal infinite crystals because they contain many defects (such as surfaces, interfaces, grain boundaries, stacking faults, dislocations, vacancies, interstitials, and so on) whose presence can dramatically affect the properties of a material. Since the 1980s, physicists have developed a theoretical framework for studying the nature and properties of solids, using a quantum mechanical description that does not rely on adjustable parameters. Advances in computational power have made it possible to use this approach for describing realistic solids, including their defects, with remarkable accuracy - even to predict properties of novel materials not yet synthesized in the laboratory.\n\nEfthimios Kaxiras and his coworkers use these theoretical methods to study the properties of solids (including, for example, materials assembled from exotic carbon fullerenes), surfaces, and interfaces. They also employ them to explain the microscopic reasons for ductile or brittle behavior. In recent work, they have applied them, in combination with other techniques, to semiconductor crystal growth and other nonequilibrium phenomena. First, they calculate a few key quantities, such as diffusion and exchange barriers, using the quantum mechanical approach. They then use these quantities in more elaborate, stochastic (Monte Carlo) simulations that make direct contact with experiment.\n\nKaxiras has used this approach to unravel the features of complex dynamical phenomena such as surfactant-mediated hetero-epitaxial growth of semiconductors. Their analysis correctly reproduces growth instabilities, including the transition from layer-by-layer to island growth, and more detailed microscopic features, such as the fractal nature of islands and their size distribution during growth."

The BEEM images show enhanced current through quantum dots located by the STM topography. Further, BEEM current spectra (collector current vs. tip voltage) show structures at tip biases below the Schottky barrier threshold, when positioned above the dot. When the tip is positioned off the dot, no such structure is observed. The results provide the first evidence of resonant tunneling through a zero-dimensional (0D) state within SAQDs.\n\nBEEM is also being used for probing such fundamental properties as heterojunction band offsets, transport in new and technologically important wide bandgap semiconductors such as GaN and AlGaInP, and tunneling through \"minibands\" of semiconductor superlattices.

Examples of the phenomena studied include the theoretically predicted stratification, or atomic layering, at the surfaces of liquid metals; the power law singularity in two- dimensional thermal excitations on the surfaces of liquids; quantum mechanical predictions of an asymmetry in the electron density profile between superfluid 4He and its vapor; structure and the structure and thermal fluctuations of thin wetting liquid films adsorbed onto both liquid and solid surfaces."

"Sachdev Lab","http://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/sachdev.html","Quantum mechanics was originally developed by Schroedinger and Heisenberg as a theory of non-relativistic charged particles interacting via the Coulomb force, and successfully applied to a simple two-particle system like the hydrogen atom. However, among its most important applications has been the description of 1023 particles found in macroscopic matter. The earliest example of this was the Sommerfeld-Bloch theory of electronic motion in metals, and its refined formulation in Landau\'s Fermi liquid theory. Although solving Schroedinger\'s wave equation for 1023 interacting electrons appears an impossibly daunting task, Landau outlined a powerful strategy, involving the concept of \'quasiparticles\', which allowed an essentially exact description of the low temperature properties of metals. The quasiparticles have an essentially free electron-like character. Although interactions between the electrons do strongly renormalize various parameters in the effective Hamiltonian, the quantum dynamics of the quasiparticles is essentially that of nearly free electrons, each of which can be described independently by single-particle quantum mechanics.\n\nSince the mid-80\'s, much attention has been lavished on a variety of transition metal compounds, whose physical properties do not fit easily into the Landau paradiagm. The most important among these compounds are ceramics, like YBa2Cu3O7, in which the electronic motion occurs primarily in two-dimensional CuO2 layers, and which display high temperature superconductivity. It is clear that electron-electron interactions are playing a much more fundamental role here, and the excitations are qualitatively different from individual electrons.\n\nSubir Sachdev\'s research has focused on the classification of the many-body ground states of interacting electrons, especially in two spatial dimensions. Fundamental distinctions between such ground states imply that they cannot be smoothly connected to each other (whereas the Landau Fermi liquid is smoothly connected to the independent electron state). Such states are necessarily separated by quantum phase transitions at a quantum critical point (QCP). The QCP has novel properties and usually does not permit a quasiparticle description. Although the QCP is only a special point in the zero temperature phase diagram, it turns out to be a useful point of departure for understanding the physical properties of phases in its vicinity both at zero and non-zero temperatures. Remarkably, it is often the case that quantum mechanics is crucial to understanding the collective properties of 1023 electrons in these materials, even at temperatures as high as room temperature and at the longest time and distance scales."
"Samuel Lab","http://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/samuel.html","Animals are intrinsically computational. We acquire sensory information about our environments, transform this information into neural representations and memories, and calculate and execute decisions based on recent and past experiences. Our own brains are staggeringly complex, with billions of neurons networked by trillions of synapses. But the basic \'stuff\' of our brains - molecular and cellular structures and interactions - is shared with our simplest animal relatives. Thus simple and well-chosen model organisms can be accessible vantage points with perspective over general biological principles. We study brain and behavior in the roundworm C. elegans. The worm only has 302 neurons, but is capable of a variety of behaviors that display a range of computational powers. We focus specifically on navigational behaviors to physical sensory inputs. Physical sensory inputs can be delivered to the behaving worm both reliably and quantifiably. Navigation itself can be reduced to a quantified pattern as an alternating sequence of forward movements, turns, and reversals. From the systematic analysis of outward motile behavior we can infer the inner workings of neural algorithms. Applying recent advances in microscopy and optics, we are also able to manipulate and monitor the workings of these neural circuits in the intact animal. In this way, we strive to link brain and behavior in the simple but fascinating creature."
"Schwartz Lab","http://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/schwartz.html","Matthew Schwartz\'s research is focused on expanding the boundaries of our current understanding of particle physics. This includes both developing new theoretical techniques for precision calculations and exploring the phenomenological consequences of new physics scenarios. He has contributed to diverse realms of particle physics, such as supergravity, strong dynamics, flavor physics, quantum chromodynamics, B-physics, grand unification, and non-perturbative models of nuclear structure based on extra dimensions. \n\nHis current research is devoted to getting better theoretical control over difficult but critically important discovery channels at the Large Hadron Collider  (LHC). To this  end, he work mostly in two broad areas: developing new ideas and methods for precision calculations in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and in isolating  distinguishing features of new physics models. \n\nIn his work on QCD, Prof. Schwartz has been exploring how to take calculations of important observables at colliders to new levels of precision. By expanding in  variables more appropriate than the strong coupling constant, such as jet masses, he has provided he world\'s best calculation of a number of observables, including  some e+e- event shapes and the spectrum of high energy gauge bosons at hadron colliders. Professor Schwartz has also been instrumental in establishing the field of  jet substructure as an essential component of the LHC program.

"Shapiro Lab","http://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/shapiro.html","Irwin Shapiro, the former Director of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, has had a very localized geographical career - all in Cambridge - but has wandered widely in research, from study of the core of the Earth, through remote-sensing exploration of the solar system, to observation of the most distant known objects in the universe. He also originated and carried out solar-system tests of the general theory of relativity. The common thread tying these various topics together is his use of radio or radar techniques in all of these efforts. Most recently, Shapiro has been concentrating on radio studies of gravitational lenses and supernovae, seeking to determine the size scale and age measure of the universe-the Hubble constant-free from the errors affecting more conventional such estimates. For example, the first gravitational lens system discovered, 0957+561, is on the verge of yielding to sustained attack; robust models of the lens\' mass distribution, coupled with radio, optical, and x-ray observations of the system\'s brightness variations appear to imply a Hubble constant of 65 km s-1 Mpc-1, with a standard error estimated to be about 10 percent."
"Silvera Lab","http://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/silvera.html","Isaac Silvera\'s research is in both condensed matter and physics of cold particles. His interests are in ultra high pressure and low-temperature physics of quantum fluids.\n\nWigner and Huntington predicted, over 70 years ago, that under high pressure solid molecular hydrogen would become an atomic metal.  Theoretical predictions that it might be a liquid at high pressure, a room temperature two-component superconductor, superfluidity, etc. have spurred the effort to produce this in the laboratory. Our high-pressure physics uses diamond anvil cells to compress samples to pressures approaching 3 megabar. The focus is on hydrogen and its isotopes, with an effort to produce and study metallic hydrogen. The low-pressure molecular hydrogen isotopes undergo a number of phase transitions as pressure is increased. New phases of orientational order called the broken symmetry phase and an as yet uncharacterized phase called the hydrogen-A phase above 1.5 megabar have been discovered. Techniques involve Raman scattering, IR spectroscopy, pulsed laser heating, NMR, equation of state measurements, conductivity, synchrotron x-ray studies, etc. Recent developments in the area of pulsed laser heating of samples use short, high power pulses at infrared wavelengths; samples can be heated to several thousand degrees K. A peak in the melting line as a function of pressure that we found is a possible precursor of liquid atomic metallic hydrogen.\n\nAn effort is underway is to stabilize and study multi-electron bubbles  (MEBs) in superfluid helium. These are spherical bubbles containing from 2 to of order 108 electrons and have diameters of tens of nanometers to hundreds of microns. Due to Coulomb repulsion the electrons reside on the surface of the bubble in helium and form a two-dimensional gas. Extremely high surface densities are predicted. In current experiments MEBs have been observed with high-speed photography. Experiments are being designed to trap MEBs with EM fields, to visually observe static bubbles and measure some of their properties. At high enough density or low temperature the electron gas is expected to form a Wigner lattice, and at still higher densities the lattice is predicted to quantum melt due to increasing zero-point motion. Bubbles have dynamic modes of oscillation (spherical ripplons), high frequency plasma modes, etc. Superconductivity has been predicted on a BCS model with electron-ripplon coupling and is within access of experiment."
"Strominger Lab","http://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/strominger.html","The fundamental laws of nature, as we currently understand them, are both incomplete and self-contradictory. Unsolved problems include the unification of forces and particles, the origin of the universe and the quantum structure of black holes and event horizons. Professor Strominger\'s research has endeavored to shed light on these problems using a variety of approaches. The emergence of string theory as a potential unified theory of nature began with Strominger\'s co-discovery of Calabi-Yau compactifications. This construction demonstrated that string theory not only reconciles quantum mechanics and gravity, but can also contain within it electrons, protons, photons and all the other observed particles and forces, and hence is a viable candidate for a complete unified theory of nature. Strominger co-discovered the brane solutions of string theory, and subsequently used them to unravel the intricate and beautiful duality symmetries of the theory. The branes were eventually used by Strominger and collaborators to give a microscopic demonstration of how black holes are able to holographically store information; resolving a deep paradox uncovered by Hawking and Bekenstein a quarter century earlier. He and coworkers also used the branes to derive new relations in algebraic geometry, equating the moduli space of a brane in a Calabi-Yau space to the mirror Calabi-Yau4, and relating the Donaldson-Thomas to the Gromov-Witten invariants.\n\nStrominger\'s recent research has focused on universal aspects of black holes and horizons, which do not depend on detailed microphysical assumptions. A new conformal symmetry of rapidly spinning black holes was discovered and used to explain how they holographically store quantum information. Strominger and coworkers found a mathematically precise mathematical relation between the Navier-Stokes and Einstein equation, demonstrating that horizons evolve as incompressible fluids and providing a bridge between fluid dynamics and general relativity. Very recent efforts have addressed the quantum structure of the cosmological horizons which likely surround us."

"Vafa Lab","http://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/vafa.html","Cumrun Vafa\'s primary area of research is string theory.  String theory, a subject that is about four decades old, is at the center of efforts by theoretical physicists to find a unified fundamental theory of nature.  String theory provides a framework to unify everything we know about nature, including all particles and the forces between them, in a consistent quantum theory.  This is an ambitious goal, given that it aims to describe physical phenomena involving scales 10^25 times smaller than the atom, as well as the cosmology of our entire universe, which involves a scale of about 10^37 times bigger than the atom. In a single theory, one studies the mysteries of confinement of quarks inside atomic nuclei, as well as enigmatic properties of astrophysical objects such as black holes.\n\nSuch an all-encompassing theory necessarily requires a tremendous amount of mathematical technology.  In fact, most of the mathematics needed for string theory is not even yet developed.  String theorists thus have the exciting task of building new mathematics as tools to explore new laws of physics. It is therefore not surprising that string theory is at the cross roads of many fields, including mathematics, particle phenomenology and astrophysics. Cumrun Vafa\'s research has involved essentially all these aspects.  Together with his colleagues he has worked on topological strings, trying to elucidate some new mathematics originating from string theory (notably in his work on mirror symmetry) and using these techniques to uncover some of the mysteries of black holes, particularly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.  He has also applied these ideas to particle theories by geometrically engineering quantum field theories, as well as solving the strong coupling dynamics of confining theories (using large N matrix model technology) and geometrizing string theory defects (in a limit of string theory known as F-theory).  His recent work involves applying these ideas to come up with stringy predictions about what the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN may potentially discover in the near future."

"Weitz Lab","http://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/weitz.html","David Weitz\'s group studies the physics of soft condensed matter, materials which are easily deformed by external stresses, electric, magnetic or gravitational fields, or even by thermal fluctuations. These materials typically possess structures which are much larger than atomic or molecular scales; the structure and dynamics at the mesoscopic scales determine macroscopic physical properties. The goal of this research is to probe and understand the relationship between mesoscopic structure and bulk properties. We study both synthetic and biological materials; our interests extend from fundamental physics to technological applications, from basic materials questions to specific biological problems. The techniques we use include video image analysis, light scattering, optical microscopy, rheology, and laser tweezing. We also develop new techniques to study these materials; we pioneered the use of multiple scattered waves to study dynamics and mechanical properties of materials, and applied these optical methods to measure the rheological properties of materials in what is now called microrheology.\n\nThere are currently three major research themes in the group. The first is colloid physics, which includes the study of colloidal particles as models systems for the study of materials. We investigatge the growth and dynamics of colloidal crystals, glasses and gels; light scattering and confocal microscopy are combined to probe both structure and dynamics of these materials. We investigate the structure and properties of glasses and gels formed with attractive interactions, and search for the universal behavior that can describe such disordered structures. This work is motivated both by fundamental interest and important applications of these systems to create novel structures and to model the properties of materials.\n\nA second major theme is biophysics. We focus on the mechanical properties of cells, and develop new methods to probe these properties. We use purified proteins to form reconstituted biopolymer networks, and study rheological properties of these systems. By incorporating molecular motors into these networks, we study the properties of highly non-equilibrium, active materials, and develop models to describe the properties of such materials. We apply the insight gained from these model systems to investigate the mechanical behavior of cells.\n\nThe third major theme is microfluidics, where our focus is on the use of multiphase fluid flow to create, control and use emulsions with microfluidic devices. We engineer novel structures made from colloids, polymers or lipids that can be used to encapsulate materials. These structures are formed from multiple emulsions which are controllably produced with microfluidic devices. In addition, we are developing microfluidic devices that use individual droplets as microreactors, with volumes as small as femtoliters. The precise control over these droplets afforded by the microfluidic devices enables us to use them as reaction vessels for very high throughput studies of biological reactions. We are developing methods to improve the functionality of enzymes through directed evolution of their function, and to study the properties of large populations of individual cells encapsulated within the droplets.\n\nOur work spans fundamental science to direct applications. Many projects are carried out in collaboration with industry; we do the fundamental science that also addresses important technological questions. In addition, some of our work is spun out into start-up companies, providing alternate career opportunities."
